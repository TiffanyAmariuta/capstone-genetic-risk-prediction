## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics depending on what your team has decided to do for the Quarter 2 Project. 

## Reading

For everyone, please read the following papers on eQTL fine-mapping and enrichment analysis: 
* [CAVIAR eQTL fine-mapping manuscript](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196608/)
  (Read these sections: Introduction, Results: Overview of statistical fine mapping, Materials and Methods: The traditional fine-mapping study approach, Data-generating model for fine-mapping studies up to "maximizing the likelihood function", Optimization, Incorporating functional data as a prior into CAVIAR) [CAVIAR software](http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/caviar/)
* [Enrichment of cis-eQTLs in functional annotations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6506796/) (Read these sections: Materials and Methods: cis-eQTL Causal Variation Enrichment, Results: Improved Enrichment of Gene Expression Causal Variation)
* [Enrichment of cis-eQTLs in GWAS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7737656/) (Read these sections: Genetic regulatory effects mediate complex trait associations (Figure 5 A shows enrichment results), Supplement: section 13.3.1 Overrepresentation of eVariants/sVariants among GWAS catalog variants )

For the team of Samuel, Jacqueline, Esha, and Moksha, please read the following paper on TWAS: 
* [TWAS method](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767558/)

For the team of Andrew, Karthik, Maddie, and Michael, please read the following papers on genome assembly and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA):
* [Release of CHM13](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj6987)
* [GSEA](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0506580102)

## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:

* Download the [CAVIAR software](http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/caviar/) and get it to run on one gene locus. 
* For the team of Samuel, Jacqueline, Esha, and Moksha, download [TWAS software](http://gusevlab.org/projects/fusion/) and understand what input files you will need to run it. 
* For the team of Andrew, Karthik, Maddie, and Michael, download [GSEA software](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp) and understand what input files you will need to run it. 

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions on Gradescope:
* From Hormozdiari 2014 Genetics, why do we want to perform fine-mapping on cis-eQTL associations?
* For the team of Samuel, Jacqueline, Esha, and Moksha, what can TWAS tell you about the relationship between gene expression and disease?
* For the team of Andrew, Karthik, Maddie, and Michael, what can GSEA tell you about the relationship between genes sharing a similar feature profile?
