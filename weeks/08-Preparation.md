## Topics

This week, please work on your quarter 1 projects and the writeup of your quarter 2 project proposal with your teammates. Everyone should be in a group of 2-4; 4 would be great so then we'll have exactly two groups of the same size in our section. Remember, once you pick your Q2 teammates, they cannot be changed. 


## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:

* Discuss with your teammates how you will delegate the work for the Quarter 1 project. 
* Finalize your analysis results so that you can write the interpretation of your analysis in your manuscripts and make high quality figures. 

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions on Gradescope:
* Please write down your teammates for the Q1 project and the Q2 project proposal (can be different teammates for each).
* Please write down which tasks you have been delegated for the Q1 project.
* Tell me the progress on your tasks; have you hit any roadblocks? What percentage complete do you consider your delegated tasks?
