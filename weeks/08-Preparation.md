## Topics

This week, please work on your quarter 1 projects and the writeup of your quarter 2 project proposal with your teammates. Everyone should be in a group of 2-4; 4 would be great so then we'll have exactly two groups of the same size in our section. Remember, once you pick your Q2 teammates, they cannot be changed. 


## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:

* Discuss with your teammates how you will delegate the work for the Quarter 1 project. 
* Finalize your analysis results so that you can write the interpretation of your analysis in your manuscripts and make high quality figures. 
* Discuss with your Q2 teammates what new analyses you will do in Q2. These can be based on the list we made in class the week prior. For example, fine-mapping, gene set enrichment analysis, ATAC-seq (or other functional annotation) enrichment analysis across cell types, enrichment of GWAS summary statistics in cis-eQTLs. 

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions on Gradescope:
* Please write down your teammates for the Q1 project and the Q2 project proposal (can be different teammates for each).
* Please write down which tasks you have been delegated for the Q1 project.
* Tell me the progress on your tasks; have you hit any roadblocks? What percentage complete do you consider your delegated tasks? 
* What new analyses have you chosen to do for the Q2 project?
