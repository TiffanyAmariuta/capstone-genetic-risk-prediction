## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topic:
* genomic annotation using high throughput experimental approaches to understand the cellular and biological context of cis-eQTLs

## Reading

Please read the following:
* [Landmark paper for Roadmap Epigenomics consortium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25693563/)
  (Read the parts of the paper about the different types of experimental assays and the use of this information to interpret disease associations)
* [ENCODE consortium resource paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2493-4)
  (Again, read the parts about different types of genomic assays and learn about what we learn from each of them)

## Tasks

* [Download any functional annotation dataset for LCLs from the ENCODE website (should be 6-column bed file format)](https://www.encodeproject.org/)
* Intersect the genomic positions of this functional annotation with the variants and genes you have been looking at in your cis-eQTL models. Is there any overlap? Can you infer anything biologically about the mechanism by which genetic variation affects gene expression? 

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions on Gradescope:

* What are two names of experimental assays to measure open chromatin? 
* What is the importance of measuring open chromatin? What does it mean about the functional potential of the DNA?
* What are some examples of histone modifications that enhance gene expression and what are some examples of histone modifications that suppress gene expression?
