# Methods and analysis of genotyping + introduction to population genetics

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
* Why genotyping data is heavily protected due to reidentification issues. 
* How next gen sequencing is used to genotype samples for genetic analysis. 
* Implications of rare (< 1 percent), low frequency (1 - 5 percent), and common alleles (> 5 percent) on disease. 

## Reading

Please read the following:
* [Review paper on next generation sequencing to call genotypes](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2986)
  (Read the introduction, section on Alignment and Assembly, Genotype and SNP Calling, Probabilistic Methods, Incorporating LD information)
* [Review paper on privacy concerns and ethics surrounding genomics data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-022-00455-y)
  (Read all main text)
* [Review paper on population genetics and allele frequency spectrum](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411010695?via%3Dihub)

## Tasks
TO DO: Download plink from [HERE](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/)

Using the 1000 Genomes genotype data:
* how many alleles are common (MAF > 5%); how many alleles are of low frequency (1% < MAF < 5%) or rare (MAF < 1%)?
* if you stratify the individuals in 1000 Genomes based on ancestry and make a list of common alleles for each ancestry, what is the overlap across populations?

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions on Gradescope:

* What is the tradeoff between rare and common alleles in studying the genetics of human disease?
* What are the risks associated with the distribution of personally identifiable genetic data?
