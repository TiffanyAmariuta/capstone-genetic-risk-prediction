## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topic:
* Querying linkage disequilibrium between variants. 
* Fine-mapping cis-eQTL loci to identify several (usually 1-5) putative causal cis-eQTLs. 
* Functional fine-mapping with PAINTOR, using ATAC-seq from ENCODE as input. 

## Reading

Please read the following:
* [LocusZoom: plotting cis-eQTL associations in a gene locus](http://locuszoom.org/)
  (Navigate to either Interactive LocusZoom.js or Original LocusZoom on the right-hand column of the webpage. Download the necessary software.)


## Tasks

* Follow the tutorial for LocusZoom. 
* Use LocusZoom to plot cis-eQTL associations from your dataset. On the y-axis, we want the -log10 P of the cis-eQTL. On the x-axis, we want the genomic position of the variants. And the color of the variants will correspond to the linkage disequilibrium (r2 of genotypes) between the lead variant (variant with largest -log10P) and each other variant in turn.
